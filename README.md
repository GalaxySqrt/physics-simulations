In this project, firstly in initial versions, I will include a program with simple Physics formulas and algorithms.

A kind of repository of Halliday's formulas.

After a while, I will come up with a way to integrate all possible equations, so that, given a scenario where there is a variable x, it can be converted into any variable y (once delivering the necessary parameters).

Finally, if possible, in the future I think about creating a complete 3D Physics simulator, taking advantage of the formulas and knowledge acquired over time
